IF THE BOT IS IN A DISCORD CHANNEL IT WILL GET ALL MESSAGES IN THAT CHANNEL
BOTS ALSO ANNOUNCE THEIR ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE NICELY, UNLIKE SLACK.

HOW TO ADD A BOT TO A SERVER?
USE THIS URL AND SELECT THE SERVER 
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=538274148024320000&scope=bot&permissions=116736.

ITS JUST ONE INSTANCE OF A BOT - HANDLES ALL GUILDS - NO NEED FOR PER-COMPANY AUTHENTICATION
JUST ADD THE BOT - THEY HAVE OAUTH STUFF - NOT SURE HOW IT'S USED.

EVEN THE GUILDS - DON'T REALLY NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM, DISCORD AUTOMATICALLY DOES WHEN YOU USE
THE AUTHENTICATION URL ABOVE TO ADD A BOT TO A GUILD - IT'S IN, PERIOD. TESTBOT CONFIRMS THIS.

THIS WILL REQUIRE A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT - GOING TO BE MUCH SIMPLER THAN SLACK'S VERSION

ONLY ISSUE IS ADDING LINKS - FROM SLACK -> DISCORD AND VICE VERSA

HOW DOES THE DISCORD BOT TELL THE SLACK BOT TO START LISTENTING FOR SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE
AND VICE VERSA? THE MESSAGE WILL JUST ARRIVE TO BE DUMPED ON THE CORRECT CHANNEL, IT'S THE
FIRST PASS THAT'S AN ISSUE (BASICALLY TELL THE OTHER SIDE YOU NEED TO LISTEN FOR SOMETHING)

TWO WAYS TO DO IT
1. GET AN INCOMING MESSAGE AND LOOK FOR WHERE IT'S GOING, TRY TO SEND IT, IF IT FAILS, RELOAD
   THE LINKS TO SEE IF IT'S BEEN ADDED (OR SEARCH THE DB DIRECTLY FOR THE NEW LINK) - THIS MIGHT
   NOT BE BAD BUT MY HOUSEKEEPING ISN'T VERY GOOD AND THIS COULD END UP SPINNING AROUND BADLY.
2. SEND A /CMD/LINKS MESSAGE SINCE THE BOTS WILL HAVE SEPARATE LINK STRUCTURES WHICH JUST TELLS
   THE BOT TO REFRESH THE LINKS - BASICALLY ANY TIME SAVELINKS() GETS RUN ON EITHER END - THIS
   IS PROBABLY THE MOST SENSIBLE FOR NOW
