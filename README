IF THE BOT IS IN A DISCORD CHANNEL IT WILL GET ALL MESSAGES IN THAT CHANNEL
BOTS ALSO ANNOUNCE THEIR ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE NICELY, UNLIKE SLACK.

HOW TO ADD A BOT TO A SERVER?
USE THIS URL AND SELECT THE SERVER 
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=538274148024320000&scope=bot&permissions=116736.

ITS JUST ONE INSTANCE OF A BOT - HANDLES ALL GUILDS - NO NEED FOR PER-COMPANY AUTHENTICATION
JUST ADD THE BOT - THEY HAVE OAUTH STUFF - NOT SURE HOW IT'S USED.

EVEN THE GUILDS - DON'T REALLY NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM, DISCORD AUTOMATICALLY DOES WHEN YOU USE
THE AUTHENTICATION URL ABOVE TO ADD A BOT TO A GUILD - IT'S IN, PERIOD. TESTBOT CONFIRMS THIS.

THIS WILL REQUIRE A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT - GOING TO BE MUCH SIMPLER THAN SLACK'S VERSION
